Q3:

Table: categories
•	id (integer, primary key)
•	name (string)
•	parent_id (integer, foreign key to categories(id), nullable)
This schema uses a single table to represent the categories and their relationships. Each row in the table represents a category, and the parent-child relationships between categories are represented using a foreign key to the parent category's id.
Using this schema, the data from the tree above would be stored as follows:
id	Name	 parent_id
1	Root	 null
2	Ant	     1
3	Bear	 1
4	Cat	     3
5	Dog	     3
6	elephant 5
7	Frog	 1
In this example, the root category has a null value for parent_id since it has no parent category. The other categories have their parent_id set to the id of their parent category.
This data schema allows for efficient querying of categories and their relationships. For example, to retrieve all the children of a given category, you can simply query for all the categories where the parent_id matches the id of the given category.



Q4
The two routes mentioned above are:
•	Retrieve a category and its children
•	Create a new category
Here are sample queries/code to support each route using the data schema proposed in my previous answer.
1.	Retrieve a category and its children:
To retrieve a category and its children, we can use a recursive SQL query. Here is an example using PostgreSQL syntax:

WITH RECURSIVE category_tree(id, name, parent_id) AS (
  -- start with the given category
  SELECT id, name, parent_id
  FROM categories
  WHERE id = $1
  
  UNION ALL
  
  -- recursively retrieve the children of the category
  SELECT c.id, c.name, c.parent_id
  FROM categories c
  JOIN category_tree ct ON c.parent_id = ct.id
)
SELECT id, name, parent_id
FROM category_tree;



In this query, the $1 parameter represents the ID of the category to retrieve. The WITH RECURSIVE clause defines a recursive common table expression that starts with the given category and recursively retrieves its children using a JOIN condition. The final SELECT statement returns the rows from the common table expression.
2.	Create a new category:
To create a new category, we can use an SQL INSERT statement. Here is an example using Python and the psycopg2 library to execute the query:

import psycopg2

# Connect to the database
conn = psycopg2.connect(database="mydatabase", user="myuser", password="mypassword", host="localhost", port="5432")

# Execute the INSERT statement
cur = conn.cursor()
cur.execute("INSERT INTO categories (name, parent_id) VALUES (%s, %s)", ("new category", 3))
conn.commit()

# Close the connection
cur.close()
conn.close()
In this example, the psycopg2 library is used to connect to a PostgreSQL database and execute an INSERT statement. The VALUES clause specifies the name and parent_id of the new category. The commit() method is used to commit the transaction, and the close() method is used to close the cursor and connection.
